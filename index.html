        <p> <strong>Hello, everyone!</strong> I'm Bleach. Your new favorite college webpage
        <em>designer</em> (I love that word so much, artist here!). Today is about webpages and
        recipes, so do not worry. I have something cooked up for you.</p>

        <p>Just kidding. You'll do the cooking yourselves. I'm just here to provide you with
        the basic knowledge you need to make magic meals!</p>

        <p>These are some of the recipes I have cooked-I seriously need to stop saying that- compiled
        for you to enjoy your happy breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert or whatever;</p>

        <ul>
            <li> <a href="./recipes/grandma-sandwich.html" target="_blank">My Grandma Sandwich</a> </li>
            <li> <a href="./recipes/ice-cream-cake.html" target="_blank">Ice Cream Sandwich Cake</a> </li>
            <li> <a href="./recipes/grilled-greek-chicken.html" target="_blank">Grilled Greek Chicken</a> </li>
        </ul>

        <p>I hope you like the recipes I have put up here. I promise this is not the last time we would be
        communicating. Have a nice read and cook!
