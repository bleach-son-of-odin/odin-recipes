        <h2>Your Go-To Ice Cream. And it's a Cake! And Sandwich!</h2>

        <p> <strong>You might</strong> be wondering: <em>Bleach likes sandwiches.</em> Yeah, well, I wonder too. But let's focus less on the sandwich part. It's the cake, the dessert, that matters. So I made this cake, and boy did it taste good to the point there weren't any leftovers and a little girl renamed it "The Best Dessert I've Ever Eaten!"</p>

        <p>Let's go on and see what magic this recipe has to offer!</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>24 vanilla ice cream sandwiches, unwrapped</li>
                <li>2 (8 ounce) containers whipped topping (such as Cool Whip®), thawed</li>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) jar hot fudge ice cream topping, warmed</li>
                <li>1 (12 ounce) jar caramel ice cream topping</li>
                <li>¼ cup chopped pecans, or to taste</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange a layer of ice cream sandwiches in the bottom of a 9x13-inch dish; top with a layer of whipped topping, hot fudge topping, and caramel topping. Repeat layering with remaining ice cream sandwiches, whipped topping, hot fudge topping, and caramel topping, ending with a top layer of whipped topping. Sprinkle with pecans. Or crushed Butterfinger candy bar.</li>
                <li>Cover the dish with aluminum foil and freeze until set, about 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
